# G4NumpyAnalysis

This is a wrapper class for cnpy[https://github.com/rogersce/cnpy] developed for use in Geant4 simulations. While it was developed for the framework of Geant4 it may be useful for other threaded applications, as such there is no dependence on Geant libraries.

[I will add the rest of the readme during the following days.]
